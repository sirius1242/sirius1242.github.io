# Some thought about the sinking of traditional Chinese medical science

It seems that traditional Chinese medical science is sinking now, but, chinese traditional medicine is for solve the root cause of disease which western medicine is palliative, why former sinks?

After discussing, I found some conclusions:

- It's easy to be a doctor who major in western medicine, but to be a good doctor of chinese traditional medicine, you need to practicing medicine for many years, so the good doctors in chinese history are nearly total old men. In the impetuous society of this age, several men will pay many years to be a good doctor with conscience. And western medicine classify situations by diseases, but traditional chinese medicine use different solutions for not only diseases, but also people and other factors, so if you want to treat some problems of feet, chinese medicine may not treat your feet and treat other parts. Traditional chinese medicine based on experience while western medicine based on a complete and detailed system, so it's easier comparing to former (although it's very hard to be a doctor who major in western medicine, too).

- We lost much in the inheriting of traditions. It always be family-inheriting in old ages, so father will inherit all technologies to sons with nothing left. However, most of these do not inherit in this format now, so the master won't inherit with nothing left, the master need to live with it. And, there are definite lost when inheriting, only not so much comparing to former.

- The quality of herbal medicine is worse than years before. Doctors always pick up them in the mountains in ancient times, but now, herbs are mostly breeded in batch, what the effect of herbs like is easy to imagine, and there may be some pollutions in the breeding of herbs, the effect will be worse.

- Herb medcines most are bitter, so people don't want to drink it, however, there may be some sugar to inprove the taste of western medicine, so people (especially children) prefer the latter. Not popular cause the vicious cycle.

- There are some bad product which use fame of herb medicine didn't work well (Chinese medicine have different solutions for different diseases of different people originally), so they influence the fame of chinese medicine. There once be a wave for foreign things are all good, chinese things are all bad (related of the bad qualities of many things in chinese society), so many young people reject native things.

- there maybe other reasons, and these are all based on horizon of mine, if you don't think so, don't spray XD.

All in all, I think traditional chinese medical science is a rich wealth given from our ancestors, and if used properly, it may be better than western medicine. We shouldn't lost the good things of ancestors, but got the bad things of them.

# This is my github page
#### last repository is deleted by me because unsucessfully theme using XD

I may put some things on the page

### this is the entrance:
[https://sirius1242.github.io](https://sirius1242.github.io)

### I wrote a shell script: `create_post.sh`
after you cloned it, you need to adjust the permissions, and then execute it, the argument is the filename:
```sh
chmod +x create_post.sh
./create_post.sh "file to create"
```
